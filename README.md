in this Project, I am working with the management of Maven Telecommunications Company using PowerBi to to perform data exploration and uncover key metrics.

## Introduction

For this project, I took the role of BI analyst to solve a telecommunication business problem by investigating the customer churn rate and offer valuable insights to reduce the rate. I used PowerBi and wrote DAX to perform data exploration and uncover key metrics.As the Data Analyst, I was directed by the CMO of Maven Telecommunication company, a fictitious manufacturing company to analyze the sales  data of the company . He wants to keep an eye on the company’s Internal performance 

## Business Problem

###In this Project, I am working with the management of Maven Telecommunications Company using PowerBi to provide insight on:

1. How many customers joined the company during the last quarter? How many customers joined?

2. What is the customer profile for a customer that churned, joined, and stayed? Are they different?

3. What seem to be the key drivers of customer churn?

4. Is the company losing high value customers? If so, how can they retain them?

## The processes I took in other to provide answers to the above questions are:
* Read Through the requirment properly
* Cleaned the data using Power Query and merging necessary tables to overcome ambuguity.
* Created relationships; data modeling 
* Wrote few DAX to answer questions 
* Designed my dashboard with the reports and most important metrics.
